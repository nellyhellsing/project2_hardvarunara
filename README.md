This README file contains information required to get started with a test system based on the Raspberry Pi Pico. The system is configured to measure temperature from one or multiple DS18B20 onewire sensors and report temperature data over UART following a specific protocol.

**Bill of Materials (BOM)**
- Raspberry Pi Pico
- DS18B20 temperature sensors (as needed)
- Micro-USB cable to connect Pico to your computer
- Connection wires and optionally a breadboard

**Installation of Raspberry Pi Pico Software**
To get started, follow these steps:

1. Connect the Raspberry Pi Pico to your computer using a micro-USB cable.
2. Download and install Thonny if you haven't already.
3. Open Thonny and connect to your Raspberry Pi Pico through the COM port it uses.
4. Create a new Python project and copy all the source code from this repository to your project.
5. Upload the code to your Raspberry Pi Pico.
